# Dashboard Outdated Data Warning Feature

## Overview
The dashboard now displays warning messages when any ticker data is outdated (older than 2 days), helping users identify when data needs to be refreshed.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Outdated Data Detection
The system automatically checks all displayed tickers and identifies those with data older than 2 days from the current date.

**Logic:**
- Threshold: 2 days (configurable)
- Compares each ticker's most recent data date against current date
- Calculates how many days old the data is
- Sorts outdated tickers by age (most outdated first)

### 2. Warning Banner
A prominent warning banner appears at the top of the dashboard when outdated data is detected.

**Banner Features:**
- ⚠️ Warning icon and header
- Count of outdated tickers
- List of up to 10 outdated tickers with age badges
- "+X more" indicator if more than 10 tickers are outdated
- Dismissible (users can close it)
- Last check date display
- Helpful reminder to run data update process

**Visual Design:**
- Bootstrap warning alert (yellow/gold)
- Clear heading with icon
- Badge-based ticker list (easy to scan)
- Compact layout (doesn't overwhelm the page)
- Professional styling

### 3. Table Row Highlighting
Rows with outdated data are visually highlighted in the ticker table.

**Highlighting:**
- Yellow background (`table-warning` class) for outdated rows
- Warning triangle icon next to ticker symbol
- Tooltip showing exact age when hovering over icon
- Clear visual differentiation from current data

### 4. Enhanced Data End Column
The "Data End" column now shows age badges for quick reference.

**Age Indicators:**
- **Green "Today"**: Data from today (most current)
- **Blue "Yesterday"**: Data from yesterday (1 day old)
- **Yellow "X days ago"**: Data older than 2 days (outdated)
- Date always shown in YYYY-MM-DD format

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes (`flask_app/app.py`)

#### Import Addition
```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
```

#### Outdated Data Detection Logic
```python
# Check for outdated data (data older than 2 days)
today = datetime.now().date()
threshold_date = today - timedelta(days=2)

# Find tickers with outdated data
outdated_tickers = []
for ticker_symbol, date_info in ticker_data_ranges.items():
    if date_info['end_date'] < threshold_date:
        days_old = (today - date_info['end_date']).days
        outdated_tickers.append({
            'ticker': ticker_symbol,
            'last_date': date_info['end_date'],
            'days_old': days_old
        })

# Sort by most outdated first
outdated_tickers.sort(key=lambda x: x['days_old'], reverse=True)
```

#### Template Data
Passes to template:
- `outdated_tickers`: List of outdated ticker objects
- `today`: Current date for age calculations

### Frontend Changes (`flask_app/templates/tickers.html`)

#### Warning Banner (Lines ~25-55)
```html
{% if outdated_tickers %}
<div class="alert alert-warning alert-dismissible fade show" role="alert">
    <h5 class="alert-heading">
        <i class="bi bi-exclamation-triangle-fill me-2"></i>Outdated Ticker Data Warning
    </h5>
    <!-- Badge list of outdated tickers -->
    <!-- Dismissible button -->
</div>
{% endif %}
```

#### Table Row Highlighting
```html
{% set is_outdated = ticker.ticker in ticker_data_ranges and (today - ticker_data_ranges[ticker.ticker].end_date).days > 2 %}
<tr {% if is_outdated %}class="table-warning"{% endif %}>
```

#### Ticker Column Icon
```html
{% if is_outdated %}
<i class="bi bi-exclamation-triangle-fill text-warning ms-1" 
   title="Data is {{ (today - ticker_data_ranges[ticker.ticker].end_date).days }} days old"></i>
{% endif %}
```

#### Enhanced Data End Column
```html
{% set days_old = (today - ticker_data_ranges[ticker.ticker].end_date).days %}
{% if days_old > 2 %}
<br><span class="badge bg-warning text-dark">{{ days_old }} days ago</span>
{% elif days_old == 1 %}
<br><span class="badge bg-info text-dark">Yesterday</span>
{% elif days_old == 0 %}
<br><span class="badge bg-success text-white">Today</span>
{% endif %}
```

- Sorted by priority (oldest first)
- Quick identification of issues

### 3. Update Scheduling
**Scenario:** Planning when to run data updates

**Without Feature:**
- Unclear which data needs updating
- May update unnecessarily
- No prioritization

**With Feature:**
- Clear view of what needs updating
- Age indicators help prioritize
- Can plan efficient update runs

### 4. Historical Analysis
**Scenario:** User wants to analyze recent trends

- May not realize data is old
- Incorrect conclusions from stale data
- No warning about data gaps

**With Feature:**
- Visual warning before analysis
- Clear indication of data currency
- Can defer analysis until updated

## Configuration

### Threshold Adjustment
To change the "outdated" threshold from 2 days to another value:

**In `flask_app/app.py`:**
```python
# Change this line (currently line ~75)
threshold_date = today - timedelta(days=2)

# To (example: 3 days)
threshold_date = today - timedelta(days=3)
```

**In `flask_app/templates/tickers.html`:**
```html
<!-- Change this line (appears in 3 places) -->
{% set is_outdated = ... .days > 2 %}

<!-- To match your threshold -->
{% set is_outdated = ... .days > 3 %}
```

### Warning Message Customization
Edit the warning banner text in `tickers.html` (~line 28-52):
- Change threshold mention ("more than 2 days old")
- Modify call-to-action message
- Adjust number of tickers shown (currently 10)

### Styling Customization
Modify Bootstrap classes to change appearance:
- `alert-warning`: Change to `alert-danger` for red warning
- `table-warning`: Change row highlight color
- `badge` colors: Customize age indicator colors

## Visual Examples

### Warning Banner Example
```
⚠️ Outdated Ticker Data Warning

12 ticker(s) have data that is more than 2 days old:

[X:BTCUSD (5 days old)] [X:ETHUSD (4 days old)] [X:SOLUSD (4 days old)] ... [+4 more]

ℹ️ Consider running the data update process to refresh ticker data. Last check: 2025-10-19
```

### Table Row Example
```
Fav | Ticker            | Name    | Data End    | Status
----|-------------------|---------|-------------|--------
⭐  | X:BTCUSD ⚠️       | Bitcoin | 2025-10-14  | Active
    |                   |         | 5 days ago  |
```
(Row highlighted in yellow)

## Performance Considerations

### Calculation Overhead
- **Minimal**: Date comparisons are fast
- **O(n)**: Linear with number of displayed tickers
- **Cached**: Uses already-queried date ranges
- **No additional queries**: Leverages existing data

### Page Load Impact
- **Negligible**: ~1-5ms additional processing
- **Client-side**: Template rendering is fast
- **No AJAX**: Everything loads in one request

### Memory Usage
- **Low**: Small list of dictionaries
- **Bounded**: Limited by filtered ticker count
- **Efficient**: Only stores necessary fields

## Benefits

### User Experience
✅ **Proactive alerts**: Don't wait for users to discover stale data  
✅ **Visual clarity**: Multiple indicators (banner, row color, badges)  
✅ **Actionable**: Clear next steps (run update)  
✅ **Non-intrusive**: Dismissible banner, doesn't block workflow  
✅ **Informative**: Shows which tickers and how old  

### Data Quality
✅ **Transparency**: Users know data freshness  
✅ **Trust**: Builds confidence in system  
✅ **Accountability**: Encourages regular updates  
✅ **Visibility**: Makes gaps obvious  

### Operations
✅ **Monitoring**: Easy to spot update failures  
✅ **Prioritization**: Oldest data highlighted first  
✅ **Efficiency**: Bulk view instead of individual checks  
✅ **Documentation**: Warning serves as audit trail  

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. **Configurable threshold**: User preference for warning threshold
2. **Per-ticker thresholds**: Different expectations for different assets
3. **Email alerts**: Notify when data becomes stale
4. **Auto-update trigger**: Button to start update from warning
5. **Update history**: Show when last update ran
6. **Severity levels**: Warning (2 days), Critical (7 days)
7. **Statistics**: Average data age, update frequency
8. **API endpoint**: Check data freshness programmatically

### Advanced Features
- **Predictive warnings**: Alert before data becomes stale
- **Update scheduling**: Integrated cron management
- **Dependency tracking**: Show which tickers depend on others
- **Quality metrics**: Beyond just age (completeness, gaps)
- **Comparison view**: Compare expected vs actual update times

## Troubleshooting

### Warning Not Appearing
**Issue:** No warning shown but data seems old

**Checks:**
1. Verify `outdated_tickers` is being passed to template
2. Check if filters are hiding affected tickers
3. Confirm data actually exists in `ticker_data_ranges`
4. Validate `today` variable is correct

**Debug:**
```python
# Add to index() route
print(f"Today: {today}")
print(f"Threshold: {threshold_date}")
print(f"Outdated count: {len(outdated_tickers)}")
```

### False Positives
**Issue:** Tickers marked outdated incorrectly

**Possible Causes:**
- Server timezone mismatch
- Weekend/holiday gaps (markets closed)
- Delayed data sources

**Solution:**
```python
# Adjust threshold for weekends
import datetime
if today.weekday() >= 5:  # Saturday or Sunday
    threshold_date = today - timedelta(days=4)
```

### Performance Issues
**Issue:** Dashboard loads slowly with many tickers

**Optimization:**
```python
# Only check active, USD pair tickers
if active_only and usd_only:
    # More restrictive outdated check
```

### Styling Conflicts
**Issue:** Warning banner doesn't look right

**Fix:**
- Check Bootstrap version (requires 5.x)
- Verify Bootstrap Icons loaded
- Clear browser cache
- Check for CSS conflicts
