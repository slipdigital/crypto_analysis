# Update Ticker Data Script - Yesterday Data Only

## Change Summary
Updated `update_ticker_data.py` to only fetch data up to **yesterday** instead of today's date.

## Rationale

### Why Stop at Yesterday?

**Problem with Today's Data:**
- üìä **Incomplete data**: Today's trading data is incomplete until market close
- ‚è∞ **Timing issues**: Running script during the day gets partial data
- üîÑ **Inconsistency**: Data changes throughout the day as trading continues
- ‚ùå **Inaccurate analysis**: Partial day data skews calculations and charts

**Benefits of Yesterday:**
- ‚úÖ **Complete data**: Yesterday's data is final and won't change
- ‚úÖ **Consistency**: Same results no matter when script runs
- ‚úÖ **Accuracy**: Full trading day data for proper analysis
- ‚úÖ **Reliability**: Prevents partial data from causing issues

### Use Cases

**Daily Updates:**
- Run script anytime during the day
- Always gets complete data from previous day
- No need to wait for market close

**Automated Scheduling:**
- Can run at any hour (midnight, morning, afternoon)
- Results are consistent regardless of execution time
- Prevents duplicate/conflicting data

**Data Quality:**
- Charts show complete trading days only
- Indicators calculate from complete data
- Comparisons use full day data

## Changes Made

### Before
```python
# Get earliest available data date (2 years ago as a safe default for crypto)
earliest_available = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=730)
today = datetime.now().date()

if latest:
    # We have some data, fetch from day after latest to today
    start_date = latest + timedelta(days=1)
    if start_date > today:
        return None, None  # Already up to date
    return start_date, today
else:
    # No data yet, fetch all available history
    return earliest_available.date(), today
```

### After
```python
# Get earliest available data date (2 years ago as a safe default for crypto)
earliest_available = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=730)
# Only update up to yesterday (today's data is incomplete during trading)
yesterday = (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=1)).date()

if latest:
    # We have some data, fetch from day after latest to yesterday
    start_date = latest + timedelta(days=1)
    if start_date > yesterday:
        return None, None  # Already up to date
    return start_date, yesterday
else:
    # No data yet, fetch all available history up to yesterday
    return earliest_available.date(), yesterday
```

## Key Differences

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **End Date** | `today = datetime.now().date()` | `yesterday = (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=1)).date()` |
| **Data Range** | Up to today | Up to yesterday |
| **Completeness** | Partial if run during day | Always complete |
| **Comment** | None | Explains why yesterday |

## Behavior Examples

### Example 1: Fresh Install (No Data)
**Scenario:** First run, no historical data exists

**Before:**
- Fetches: 2 years ago ‚Üí today (includes partial today)
- Result: 730 days (including incomplete today)

**After:**
- Fetches: 2 years ago ‚Üí yesterday
- Result: 729 days (all complete)

### Example 2: Daily Update (Current Data)
**Scenario:** Running on October 20, 2025 at 10:00 AM

**Before:**
- Latest data: October 19, 2025
- Fetches: October 20, 2025 (partial day, only 10am worth of data)
- Result: Incomplete data saved

**After:**
- Latest data: October 19, 2025
- Fetches: Nothing (already up to yesterday)
- Result: "Already up to date" message

### Example 3: Daily Update (Missing Yesterday)
**Scenario:** Running on October 20, 2025, latest data is October 18, 2025

**Before:**
- Fetches: October 19 ‚Üí October 20 (2 days, Oct 20 partial)
- Result: 1 complete day + 1 partial day

**After:**
- Fetches: October 19 only
- Result: 1 complete day

### Example 4: Catching Up After Gap
**Scenario:** Running on October 20, 2025, latest data is October 10, 2025

**Before:**
- Fetches: October 11 ‚Üí October 20 (10 days, Oct 20 partial)
- Result: 9 complete + 1 partial

**After:**
- Fetches: October 11 ‚Üí October 19 (9 days)
- Result: 9 complete days

### Example 5: Weekend Run
**Scenario:** Running on Sunday, October 19, 2025

**Before:**
- Fetches: Up to October 19 (Sunday - no market)
- Result: May try to fetch non-existent Sunday data

**After:**
- Fetches: Up to October 18 (Saturday - also no market)
- Result: Same issue (markets closed weekends)

**Note:** Weekends are handled by the API returning no data, which is expected behavior.

## Impact on Dashboard

### Outdated Data Warning
With the 2-day threshold for outdated data warnings:

**Today: October 20, 2025**
**Threshold: Data older than October 18, 2025**

- Latest possible data: October 19, 2025 (yesterday)
- Warning triggers if: Data is October 17 or older
- This is correct behavior!

**Example:**
- ‚úÖ Data from Oct 19 = Not outdated (yesterday)
- ‚úÖ Data from Oct 18 = Not outdated (2 days ago, at threshold)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Data from Oct 17 = Outdated (3 days ago)

The warning system and data collection work together perfectly:
1. Script updates to yesterday (Oct 19)
2. Warning threshold is 2 days (Oct 18+)
3. Gives 1 day buffer before warning triggers

### Chart Display
- Charts show complete trading days only
- No partial data to skew visualizations
- Consistent regardless of viewing time

### Calculations
- Indicators use complete day data
- Averages and aggregations are accurate
- Comparisons use full trading days

## Running the Script

### Basic Usage
```bash
python update_ticker_data.py
```
**Result:** Updates all active tickers to yesterday

### Specific Ticker
```bash
python update_ticker_data.py --ticker X:BTCUSD
```
**Result:** Updates only Bitcoin to yesterday

### Limited Tickers
```bash
python update_ticker_data.py --limit 10
```
**Result:** Updates first 10 active tickers to yesterday

### Example Output
```
=== Processing 150 tickers ===

[1/150] ‚Üí X:BTCUSD: Fetching data from 2025-10-19 to 2025-10-19
  X:BTCUSD: Saved 1 records
[2/150] ‚úì X:ETHUSD: Already up to date
[3/150] ‚Üí X:SOLUSD: Fetching data from 2025-10-15 to 2025-10-19
  X:SOLUSD: Saved 5 records
...

=== Complete: Saved 127 total records ===
```

## Scheduling Recommendations

### Best Practice: Run Daily
```bash
# Cron job - Run at 1:00 AM every day
0 1 * * * cd /path/to/crypto_analysis && python update_ticker_data.py
```

**Why 1:00 AM?**
- Yesterday's data is definitely complete
- Markets are closed (crypto markets 24/7 but daily aggregates finalized)
- Low server load
- Runs before users check dashboard

### Alternative: Multiple Times Daily
```bash
# Run at midnight, 6 AM, and noon
0 0,6,12 * * * cd /path/to/crypto_analysis && python update_ticker_data.py
```

**Behavior:**
- First run (midnight): Gets yesterday's data
- Second run (6 AM): "Already up to date"
- Third run (noon): "Already up to date"
- All runs get same result - yesterday's complete data

### Manual Run Anytime
Script is now safe to run at any time of day:
- Morning run: Gets yesterday
- Afternoon run: Gets yesterday
- Night run: Gets yesterday
- Results are always consistent

## Edge Cases

### Running at Midnight
**Scenario:** Script runs at 12:00:01 AM on October 20

- `datetime.now()` = October 20, 12:00:01 AM
- `yesterday` = October 19
- Fetches data for October 19
- ‚úÖ Correct: Full October 19 data available

### Running on January 1st
**Scenario:** New Year's Day, last data is December 31

- `yesterday` = December 31 (previous year)
- Date calculations work across year boundary
- ‚úÖ Correct: No special handling needed

### Market Holidays
**Scenario:** Market closed for holiday

- Script attempts to fetch yesterday
- API returns no data (market closed)
- "No data available" message shown
- ‚úÖ Correct: Expected behavior

### Crypto Markets (24/7)
**Scenario:** Crypto markets never close

- Daily aggregates still calculated by exchange
- Yesterday's aggregate is complete at midnight
- ‚úÖ Correct: Gets full 24-hour period

## Testing

### Manual Test
```bash
# 1. Check current latest data
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d crypto_data -c "SELECT ticker, MAX(date) FROM ticker_data GROUP BY ticker LIMIT 5;"

# 2. Run update script
python update_ticker_data.py --limit 5

# 3. Check latest data again
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d crypto_data -c "SELECT ticker, MAX(date) FROM ticker_data GROUP BY ticker LIMIT 5;"

# 4. Verify latest date is yesterday
# If today is Oct 20, latest should be Oct 19
```

### Verify Yesterday Logic
```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

today = datetime.now().date()
yesterday = (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=1)).date()

print(f"Today: {today}")
print(f"Yesterday: {yesterday}")
print(f"Difference: {(today - yesterday).days} day")
# Should print: Difference: 1 day
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Already up to date" on Fresh Install
**Issue:** Script says up to date but no data exists

**Check:**
1. Verify ticker exists in database
2. Check if ticker is active
3. Look for error messages about API

**Not a bug:** Script correctly stops at yesterday

### Missing Today's Data
**Issue:** Dashboard doesn't show today

**Expected:** This is the new correct behavior
- Today's data is incomplete
- Only complete days shown
- Check again tomorrow

### Data is 1 Day Behind
**Issue:** Charts seem 1 day behind

**Expected:** This is correct!
- Script fetches to yesterday
- Charts show complete days only
- Run script tomorrow to get today's data (as yesterday)

## Performance Impact

### Before
- Fetches: X to today
- Possible duplicates if run multiple times per day
- Data might change if refetched

### After
- Fetches: X to yesterday
- No duplicates (yesterday won't change)
- Idempotent: safe to run multiple times
- Slightly less data per run (1 day less)

**Result:** Minimal performance difference, better data quality

## Compatibility

### Database Schema
- ‚úÖ No changes required
- ‚úÖ Uses existing TickerData table
- ‚úÖ Same columns and constraints

### API Calls
- ‚úÖ Same Polygon API endpoints
- ‚úÖ Same parameters
- ‚úÖ Just different end date

### Dashboard
- ‚úÖ No changes needed
- ‚úÖ Works with outdated warning (2-day threshold)
- ‚úÖ Charts display correctly

## Summary

### What Changed
- ‚úÖ End date changed from `today` to `yesterday`
- ‚úÖ Added explanatory comment
- ‚úÖ Updated references in conditional logic

### Why It Matters
- üéØ **Data Quality**: Only complete days
- üîÑ **Consistency**: Same results anytime
- ‚ö° **Reliability**: No partial data issues
- ‚úÖ **Best Practice**: Industry standard approach

### Files Modified
- `update_ticker_data.py` - Changed `get_date_range_for_ticker()` function

### No Breaking Changes
- ‚úÖ Script still runs the same way
- ‚úÖ Command line arguments unchanged
- ‚úÖ Output format identical
- ‚úÖ Database structure unchanged

The script now follows best practices for financial data collection by only fetching complete, finalized data!
